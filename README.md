# Word Count Prime

Takes a plaintext input file (aimed at .txt) and returns a list of the amount of occurrences each word has in the text. It also shows if that number is a prime or not.

## Getting Started

To see this in action you can download an executable by running:
`npm install -g word-count-prime'

To develop this you can run the following commands:
```
mkdir <your_directory>
cd <your_directory>
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will setup an environment that watches changes to your JavaScript files and performs automatic Testing and Linting (Standard)

### Prerequisites

To run this all you need is 

```
Node v6.9.0 or higher
NPM
```
