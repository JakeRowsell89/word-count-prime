# Word Count Prime

Takes a plaintext input file (aimed at .txt) and returns a list of the amount of occurrences each word has in the text. It also shows if that number is a prime or not.

## See For Yourself

To see this in action you can download an executable by running:

`npm install -g word-count-prime`

This should allow you to process file contents with the command `word-count-prime`:

`word-count-prime <file_name.txt>`

## Development

To develop this you can run the following commands:
```
mkdir <your_directory>
cd <your_directory>
git clone git@github.com:JakeRowsell89/word-count-prime.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will setup an environment that watches changes to your JavaScript files and performs automatic Testing and Linting (Standard)

### Prerequisites

To run this all you need is 

```
Node >=v6.9.0
NPM
```
